TimeRing is a versatile and user-friendly timer application designed to help you manage your time effectively. Whether you're working, studying, or cooking, TimeRing provides a clean and intuitive interface to run multiple timers at once. Built with PyQt5, it's designed with a focus on Linux but is architected to be cross-platform.

## üì¶ Installation

For an easy installation on Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu), a `.deb` package will be available in the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Lusan-sapkota/TimeRing/releases) section and on SourceForge. This is the recommended method for most users.

For other systems or for development, you can install from source.

### Prerequisites

Ensure Python 3.11+ and `pip` are installed on your system.

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S python python-pip

```

### Installation from Source

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Lusan-sapkota/TimeRing.git
    cd TimeRing
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    *On Windows, you would use `venv\Scripts\activate`.*

3. **Install dependencies:**

    Inside the activated virtual environment, install the required Python packages.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

### Creating a Timer

1. Enter a name for your timer.
2. Set the duration in minutes.
3. Optionally, click the **description icon** to add more details.
4. Optionally, click the **sound icon** to select a custom alarm sound.
5. Click **"Start Timer"** to begin.

### Managing Active Timers

Each active timer card displays its name, remaining time, and status. The action buttons change based on the timer's state:

- **Running**: Pause, Stop, Edit Description, Change Sound.
- **Paused**: Resume, Stop, Edit Description, Change Sound.
- **Ringing**: A **Stop** button is shown to silence the alarm. The card turns yellow.
- **Finished**: A **Rerun** button appears, allowing you to start the same timer again instantly.

### Active Timer Display

The large active timer display shows the currently selected running timer with enhanced controls:

- **Previous/Next Buttons**: Navigate between multiple running timers.
- **Enhanced Status**: Clear distinction between "Time's Up", "Paused", and "Running" states.
- **Disabled Controls**: Resume button is properly disabled for finished timers.

### Menu Header

Click each menu icon to access:

- **Settings**: Change the default sound and open the preferences dialog.
- **Help**: Quick guides and feature overviews.
- **About**: Information about the application.

## Platform Compatibility

This application is developed and tested primarily on **Linux**. Many features, especially those relying on system libraries like desktop notifications (`libnotify`) and audio (`VLC`), are tailored for a Linux environment.

While it may run on **Windows** or **macOS** with Python and PyQt5 installed, some functionalities might not work as expected out-of-the-box. The notification system, in particular, would require platform-specific implementation to work on other operating systems.

## üîß Configuration

TimeRing stores its configuration files in `~/.config/TimeRing/`:

- `settings.json`: Application preferences.
- `timers.json`: The state of all active timers.

## üé® Customization

You can customize the application's appearance by editing `style.qss`. This file uses standard Qt CSS syntax. For example, to change the primary button color:

```css
QPushButton#startButton {
    background-color: #4CAF50; /* A nice green */
}
```
