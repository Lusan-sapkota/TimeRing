## üöÄ Usage

### Creating a Timer

4. Optionally, click the **sound icon** to select a custom alarm sound.
5. Click **"Start Timer"** to begin.

### Managing Active Timers

Each active timer card displays its name, remaining time, and status. The action buttons change based on the timer's state:

- **Running**: Pause, Stop, Edit Description, Change Sound.
- **Paused**: Resume, Stop, Edit Description, Change Sound.
- **Ringing**: A **Stop** button is shown to silence the alarm. The card turns yellow.
- **Finished**: A **Rerun** button appears, allowing you to start the same timer again instantly.

### Menu Drawer

Click the hamburger menu icon (‚ò∞) to access:

- **Settings**: Change the default sound and open the preferences dialog.
- **Help**: Quick guides and feature overviews.
- **About**: Information about the application.

## Platform Compatibility

This application is developed and tested primarily on **Linux**. Many features, especially those relying on system libraries like desktop notifications (`libnotify`) and audio (`VLC`), are tailored for a Linux environment.

While it may run on **Windows** or **macOS** with Python and PyQt5 installed, some functionalities might not work as expected out-of-the-box. The notification system, in particular, would require platform-specific implementation to work on other operating systems.

## üîß Configuration

TimeRing stores its configuration files in `~/.config/TimeRing/`:

- `settings.json`: Application preferences.
- `timers.json`: The state of all active timers.

## üé® Customization

You can customize the application's appearance by editing `style.qss`. This file uses standard Qt CSS syntax. For example, to change the primary button color:

```css
QPushButton#startButton {
    background-color: #4CAF50; /* A nice green */
}
```
